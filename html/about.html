            <div class="dodge-para">
                <p><span>Dodge</span> is an American brand of automobiles and a division of Stellantis, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Dodge vehicles have historically included performance cars, and for much of its existence, Dodge was Chrysler's mid-priced brand above Plymouth.
                <br><br>
                Founded as the <span>Dodge Brothers Company</span> machine shop by brothers <span>Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge</span> in the early 1900s, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies to Detroit-based automakers like Ford. They began building complete automobiles under the <span>"Dodge Brothers"</span> brand in 1914, predating the founding of the <span>Chrysler Corporation</span>. The factory located in <span>Hamtramck, Michigan</span>, was the Dodge main factory from <span>1910 until it closed in January 1980</span>. John Dodge died from the Spanish flu in January 1920, having lungs weakened by tuberculosis 20 years earlier. Horace died in December of the same year, perhaps weakened by the Spanish flu, but the cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver. Their company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928.
                <br><br>
                Dodge's mainstay vehicles were trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, but it also built compact cars such as the 1963 through 1976 Dart and midsize cars such as the "B-Body" Coronet and Charger from 1965 until 1978.
                <br><br>
                The 1973 oil embargo caused American "gas guzzler" sales to slump, prompting Chrysler to develop the Dodge Aries K platform compact and midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s. One example was the Dodge Caravan.
                <br><br>
                The Dodge brand continued through multiple ownership changes of Chrysler from 1998 until 2009. These included its merger with Daimler-Benz AG between 1998 and 2007. Chrysler was subsequently sold by Daimler-Benz to Cerberus Capital Management. It went through the effects of the 2008 – 2010 automotive industry crisis on the United States resulting in the Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization and ultimately being acquired by Fiat.
                <br><br>
                In 2011, Dodge and its sub-brands, Dodge Ram and Dodge Viper, were separated. Dodge announced that the Viper was to be an SRT product, and Ram a standalone marque. In 2014, SRT was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, the Chrysler Group was renamed FCA US LLC, coinciding with the merger of Fiat S.p.A.. The Chrysler Group was integrated into the corporate structure of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Subsequently, another merger occurred on January 16, 2021, between FCA and the PSA Group to form Stellantis, making the Dutch-domiciled automaker the second largest in Europe, after Volkswagen.</p>

                    In 1914, the Dodge brothers decided it was time to part ways with Ford and introduce their own car. The first Dodge vehicle, built on an all-steel body (the first of its kind), left the plant on Nov. 14, 1914, and by the end of the year, 249 Dodge vehicles were built.
                    <br><br>
                    By 1915, Dodge ranked third among America’s best-selling automakers. Known for “dependability,” Dodge also offered a “winter car” with a removable hardtop and snap-on side glass.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next five years, the brothers produced commercial, civilian and military trucks, along with a 1,155mm (about 3.79 ft) gun recoil system for the Allied armies during WWI. In 1919, Dodge built its 400,000th vehicle, producing a yearly total of more than 100,000 units, all while introducing the brand’s first four-door sedan.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1960, the world saw the first Dodge Dart, a midsize model. In 1964, the brand celebrated its 50th anniversary, the Dodge Charger concept debuted and the Coronet made another appearance.
                    <br><br>
                    The Dodge Challenger made its debut in 1970 and paced the Indianapolis 500-mile race. In 1976, the compact Aspen was introduced and advertised as “the family car of the future.”
                    <br><br>
                    n 1981, the Dodge Aries K-car was introduced and was a huge hit, bolstering Chrysler Corporation’s sales for several years. The revolutionary Dodge Caravan minivan was introduced in 1984. The ’80s ended strong for the Dodge brand with the introduction of the Dynasty in 1988, which became the company’s best seller. In 1989, the brand celebrated its 75th anniversary with the introduction of the Dodge Viper concept, which debuted at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 1990s, the Dodge lineup consisted of several familiar nameplates, including the Dodge Shadow, Daytona, Intrepid, Caravan and Grand Caravan. Rounding out the decade, Dodge introduced the Power Wagon and Charger concepts and celebrated 15 years of the minivan.
                    <br><br>
                    With the new millennium came the all-new Dodge Neon, Stratus Sedan and Stratus Coupe, as well as the 2002 Dodge Ram 1500. A big year for the brand, 2003 came with the introduction of the Dodge Magnum, Kahuna and Avenger concept cars, as well as the Tomahawk, a Viper V10-engine-powered motorcycle. The Dodge Caliber concept was unveiled, and the Dodge Magnum was introduced in 2005. By 2006, a new version of the Charger was introduced, bringing back an iconic nameplate and HEMI engine power. In 2009, Dodge and Ram became two separate divisions in order to better focus on their own unique customers’ needs.
                    <br><br>
                    As part of one of the largest product renaissances, Dodge introduced six all-new or completely redesigned vehicles from 2010 to 2011, including the all-new Durango, Charger, Challenger, Avenger, Grand Caravan and Journey.
                    <br><br>
                    On July 1, 2014, the Dodge brand celebrated its 100th anniversary.
                    <br><br>
                    Present day is no different than the first 100 years of industry-breaking innovations from the Dodge brothers and their decedents. Dodge continues to bring passion and horsepower to its lineup of vehicles, which can be found on the dragstrip and among one of the most enthusiastic customer bases in the industry.
                    <br>
                    The passion of brand followers is on full display at events like the annual MotorTrend Presents Roadkill Nights Powered by Dodge, where thousands of muscle-car enthusiasts gather to talk shop, tour classic lineups and soak up all things that personify the brand’s 100-plus-year history.
                    <br>
                    While you can still get a healthy dose of speed, burning rubber and HEMI engine power in vehicles like the jaw-dropping Dodge Challenger SRT® Demon 170, with its 1,025 horsepower and blazing 0-60 time of 1.66 seconds, you also get innovation and future-facing technology.
                    <br>
                    The brand has worked tirelessly to give enthusiasts the power they desire, with customization options that truly make a one-of-a-kind Dodge vehicle, while working to redefine what future muscle cars look like, sound like and drive like with new concepts, like the battery-electric Dodge Charger Daytona SRT with its patent-pending Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust and the first-ever electrified performance vehicle from Dodge, the 2024 Hornet R/T performance hybrid.
